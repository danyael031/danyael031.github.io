title: Managing blog from your Android device with Termux and Github pages
---

Hello! In my first post of the blog i'll gonna show you how to manage your own blog from your phone using some Termux utilities and Github Pages.

### Making the webpage for our blog

Github is a development platform with the Git control version. But, for now, the only thing of our interest is his service of *Github Pages*.

Github Pages allows you to have a little static webpage to put in it anything what you want. If yo doesn't have an account already, go to [Github](https://github.com) and sign up! (don't forget verify your email).

Because we don't want to make all our blog from scratch (with all the work that it means), simply gonna fork [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) from barryclark repository. I highly recommend you to read the project description!.

![Go to desktop version and click in fork icon]()

Now go to settings and change the repository name to `username.github.io` where `username` is your user name in Github.

Go to your `username.github.io` through your browser and thats it! Now you have the basic structure of your blog!


### Installing Termux

If you doesn't know what is Termux, the description of his homepage maybe is generic, but no more no less:

> Termux is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required.

And thats it all. You can have the power of a Linux terminal in your hands.

You can instal Termux from the Google Play Store or F-droid. There is no difference, but i have preference for the F-droid version.
